		<title>Roadmap for August and September</title>
		<description>
		<![CDATA[

			<ul>
				<li>We are switching to an every other week release schedule. This should help with overall performance as features will receive additional testing.</li>
				<li>With a few exceptions, most of our engineering staff will be dedicated to performance, stability and security.</li>
				<li>New content will still be released, but the amount will go down and it will be focused on existing systems rather than adding something new.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Practically speaking, the next several weeks are going to feel a bit like the game is slowing down, but I want to assure everyone that this is not the case. Human Head and Digital Extremes are still fully committed to Survived By, and the number of staff working on this game is unaffected by the priority shift. In order to give you the best possible experience, we need to focus a little more on the guts of the game.</p>

		<p>But that's not to say that we aren't looking towards the future:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We're looking to improve the moment-to-moment gameplay with revised enemy behaviors and attack patterns while looking towards a new feature (pets) as a way to give players more tactical options in combat.</li>
				<li>We want to expand the number of short term goals players can pursue with a rebuilt bounty/challenge/achievement system while also adding more quest chains and events that cycle in and out.</li>
				<li>Our end game is also in line for updates, from expanded Ancestral Legacies to an all-new raid dungeon where players traverse the exterior roots of the World Tree to face off against a massive Fury known as The Dreadnought.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Oh, and maybe, you know, something like a new class.</p>

		<p>It might take us well into the end of 2018 to get all of this in, but we wanted to give you a sneak peek of some of the content we're prioritizing and hope it gets many of you as excited as we are for the future of Survived By.</p>
